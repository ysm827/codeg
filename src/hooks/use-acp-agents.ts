// resolution, that meant several duplicate `acpListAgents()` scans on every
// window focus and every registry-updated event. One shared, ref-counted
// subscription keeps that cost flat regardless of how many consumers mount —
// mirroring the coalescing `use-enabled-skill-ids` already does for its own
