/**
 * Warms the shiki (code) syntax-highlighting engine shortly after first paint,
 * so the first code block in a streamed response doesn't pay a multi-MB dynamic
 * import + parse on the streaming hot path (which is what made the UI hitch "when
 * code first appears"). Renders nothing.
 *
 * Warmed on whichever of two triggers fires first (prefetch is idempotent):
 *   1. First user input — a one-shot, capture-phase pointerdown/keydown listener.
 *      The first interaction reliably precedes navigating to and streaming a
 *      conversation, so this closes the race where a quick click after launch
 *      opens a code conversation before the idle timer fires. Warming before any
 *      code is on screen also avoids the re-highlight burst a mid-render engine
 *      resolution would cause.
 *   2. Idle fallback — for the rarer read-without-interacting case.
 *      requestIdleCallback is absent in WKWebView (macOS Tauri), so fall back to
 *      a short timeout there.
 *
 * Only `code` is prefetched: it's by far the most common heavy engine in
 * coding-agent output. katex (`math`) and mermaid stay purely on-demand — they're
 * rarer and mermaid pulls the heaviest dep graph, so warming them for every
 * session would just re-inflate what the lazy split was meant to save.
 *
 * The bundle split point is untouched, so shiki stays OUT of the first-paint
 * chunk — this only schedules the import a beat later, off the critical path.
 * Every listener/handle is torn down on unmount.
