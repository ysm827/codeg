//! `DelegationBroker` — the coordination unit for multi-agent delegation.
//!
//! Lifecycle of a single call:
//!
//! 1. `handle_request` is the broker's only entry point. The MCP listener
//!    feeds it the LLM-issued `delegate_to_agent` payload.
//! 2. Pre-checks: feature enabled? depth limit ok? Both failures return
//!    immediately, no child session created.
//! 3. Spawn the child via [`ConnectionSpawner::spawn`].
//! 4. Send the delegation task as the first prompt via
//!    [`ConnectionSpawner::send_prompt_linked_for_delegation`]. The trailing
//!    [`DelegationLink`] carries the parent's `tool_use_id` and a
//!    broker-internal `call_id` (UUID) — these get persisted onto the new
//!    conversation row.
//! 5. Park a `oneshot::Sender` keyed by `call_id`. Resolution comes from
//!    one of:
//!       - the listener calling [`DelegationBroker::complete_call`] on
//!         `TurnComplete` (happy path), or
//!       - a cancel — either MCP-side
//!         (`notifications/cancelled` → `cancel_by_external_handle`),
//!         child-side ([`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_child_connection`]),
//!         or parent-side ([`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_parent`]).
//! 6. On any resolution, the child connection is disconnected. v1 is
//!    explicitly one-shot — no session reuse.
//!
//! Cancellation cascade: when a parent session goes away (user-initiated
//! cancel, parent disconnect), the lifecycle subscriber calls
//! [`DelegationBroker::cancel_by_parent`] which fans out cancel + disconnect
//! to every pending child of that parent.
